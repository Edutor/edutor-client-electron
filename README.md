# Edutor client
First implementation of a client for the Edutor backend.

## Technicalities
The client is built with the [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) framework,
using the functional language [Elm](https://elm-lang.org).

Inspiration for the setup was found here: https://medium.com/@ezekeal/building-an-electron-app-with-elm-part-1-boilerplate-3416a730731f
